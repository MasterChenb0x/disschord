# disschord CHANGELOG

##### 2019/05/09
Updated the discord.py version from 0.16 to 1.0. That broke a lot of things. While fixing the break, I decided to make the code more modular and clean.

##### 2019/05/16
The InfoSec News feature needs its formatting fixed. It currently prints headlines as a list item. Need to convert back to string. README was updated with all current features.
