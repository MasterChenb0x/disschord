# disschord CHANGELOG

##### 2019/06/18
Started working on financial functions. Amortization works now. Would like to add functionality for Variable/Revolving lines of credit.

##### 2019/06/14
Basic Twitter integration is built in. Started on financial suite functions with amortization and monthly payment calculations. 

##### 2019/06/03
Moved a few triggers to respond in DM only to clear up the spamming of channels. Changed the trigger name for a dice from from !dice to !roll. Started experimenting with grabbing a list of users the bot can see. Nothing has come of that yet.

##### 2019/05/23
Added a help menu. Moved some code around in an effort to avoid having to refactor later. Continuing to add features.

##### 2019/05/17
During a discussion with a co-worker, I came to the realization that the youngins' don't know "The Bro Cide" to its entirety. So, I added a feature. It is currently triggered with `!brocode` , but eventually, I would like to make a rule from The Bro Code to post randomly in the channel.

##### 2019/05/16
The InfoSec News feature needs its formatting fixed. It currently prints headlines as a list item. Need to convert back to string. README was updated with all current features.

##### 2019/05/09
Updated the discord.py version from 0.16 to 1.0. That broke a lot of things. While fixing the break, I decided to make the code more modular and clean.
